You can use this workflow to create a user with an associated REST role.

.About this workflow

This workflow includes the typical steps needed to create a custom REST role and associate it with a new user account. Both the user and role have an SVM scope and are associated with a specific data SVM. Some of the steps may be optional or need to change depending on your environment.

== Step 1: List the data SVMs in the cluster

Perform the following REST API call to list the SVMs in the cluster. The UUID and name of each SVM are provided in the output.

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|GET
|/api/svm/svms
|===

.Curl example

[source,curl]
curl --request GET \
--location "https://$FQDN_IP/api/svm/svms?order_by=name" \
-- include \
--header "Accept: */*" \
--header "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH"

.After you finish

Select the desired SVM from the list where you will create the new user and role.

== Step 2: List the users defined to the SVM

Perform the following REST API call to list the users defined in the SVM you selected. You can identify the SVM through the owner parameter.

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|GET
|/api/security/accounts
|===

.Curl example

[source,curl]
curl --request GET \
--location "https://$FQDN_IP/api/security/accounts?owner.name=dmp" \
-- include \
--header "Accept: */*" \
--header "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH"

.After you finish

Based on the users already defined in the SVM, choose a unique name for the new user.

== Step 3: List the REST roles defined to the SVM

Perform the following REST API call to list the roles defined in the SVM you selected. You can identify the SVM through the owner parameter.

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|GET
|/api/security/roles
|===

.Curl example

[source,curl]
curl --request GET \
--location "https://$FQDN_IP/api/security/roles?owner.name=dmp" \
-- include \
--header "Accept: */*" \
--header "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
--data @JSONinput

.After you finish

Based on the roles already defined in the SVM, choose a unique name for the new role.

== Step 4: Create a custom REST role

Perform the following REST API call to a create a custom REST role in the SVM. The role initially has only one privilege which establishes a default access of *none* so that all access is denied.

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/api/security/roles
|===

.Curl example

[source,curl]
curl --request POST \
--location "https://$FQDN_IP/api/security/roles" \
-- include \
--header "Accept: */*" \
--header "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
--data @JSONinput

.JSON input example

[source,curl]
{
  "name": "dprole1",
  "owner": {
    "name": "dmp",
    "uuid": "752d96be-f17c-11ec-9d19-005056bbad91"
  },
  "privileges": [
      {"path": "/api", "access": "none"},
  ]
}

.After you finish

Optionally perform step 3 again to display the new role. You can also display the roles at the ONTAP CLI.

== Step 5: Update the role by adding more privileges

Perform the following REST API call to modify the role by adding privileges as needed.

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/api/security/roles/{owner.uuid}/{name}/privileges
|===

.Additional input parameters for curl examples

In addition to the parameters common with all REST API calls, the following parameters are also used in the curl example in this step.

[cols="25,10,10,55"*,options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Type
|Required
|Description
|$SVM_ID
|Path
|Yes
|The UUID of the SVM that contains the role definition.
|$ROLE_NAME
|Path
|Yes
|The name of the role within the SVM to be updated.
|===

.Curl example

[source,curl]
curl --request POST \
--location "https://$FQDN_IP/api/security/roles/$SVM_ID/$ROLE_NAME/priveleges" \
-- include \
--header "Accept: */*" \
--header "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
--data @JSONinput

.JSON input example

[source,curl]
{
  "path": "/api/storage/volumes",
  "access": "readonly"
}

.After you finish

Optionally perform step 3 again to display the new role. You can also display the roles at the ONTAP CLI.

== Step 6: Create a user

Perform the following REST API call to a create a user account. The role *dprole1* created above is associated with the new user.

[TIP]
You can include the user without a role. In this case youâ€™ll need to modify the user to assign a role. 

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/api/security/accounts
|===

.Curl example

[source,curl]
curl --request POST \
--location "https://$FQDN_IP/api/security/accounts" \
-- include \
--header "Accept: */*" \
--header "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
--data @JSONinput

.JSON input example

[source,curl]
{
  "owner": {"uuid":"daf84055-248f-11ed-a23d-005056ac4fe6"},
  "name": "david",
  "applications": [
      {"application":"ssh",
       "authentication_methods":["password"],
       "second_authentication_method":"none"}
  ],
  "role":"dprole1",
  "password":"netapp123"
}

.After you finish

You can sign in to the SVM management interface using the credentials for the new user.
