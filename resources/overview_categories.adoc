[.lead]
The resources available through the ONTAP REST API are organized in categories. Each of the resource categories includes a brief description along with additional usage considerations where appropriate.

The REST resources described in the summary are based on the latest version of the product. If you need a more detailed understanding of the changes made in previous releases, see link:../whats_new.html[What's new with the ONTAP REST API] as well as the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP Release Notes^].

[TIP]
For many of the REST endpoints, you can include a UUID key as part of the path string to access a specific object instance. However, in many cases you can also access objects using a property value on a query parameter.
