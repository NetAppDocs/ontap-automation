The physical disks in the cluster. This resource type was introduced with ONTAP 9.6 and updated with ONTAP 9.7 and 9.8.

.File clone

You can use these endpoints to create file clones, retrieve split status, and manage split loads. The file cloning endpoint resources were first introduced with ONTAP 9.6 and expanded with ONTAP 9.8. They were significantly expanded again with ONTAP 9.10.

.File moves

You can use these REST API endpoints to move a file between two FlexVol volumes or within a FlexGroup volume. After the request is accepted you can monitor the progress and status. This resource type was introduced with ONTAP 9.11.1.

.FlexCache

This resource type was introduced with ONTAP 9.6 and updated with ONTAP 9.8.

.FlexCache origins
