NetApp provides a lab environment for you to test the ONTAP REST API and other related automation technologies.

The Lab on Demand is available to NetApp customers and partners. You'll need valid credentials to sign in and begin using the lab resources. See https://labondemand.netapp.com[Lab on Demand^] for more information. You can search for *REST* or other technologies as needed.

Also refer to https://github.com/NetApp/ontap-rest-python/tree/master/lod[Preparing the Lab on Demand to run the sample scripts^] to get started.
