After issuing an API request that is designed to run asynchronously, a job object is always created and returned to the caller. The job describes and anchors a background task that processes the request. Depending on the HTTP status code, you must retrieve the state of the job to determine if the request was successful.

Refer to the ONTAP API online documentation page to determine which API calls are designed to be performed asynchronously.

=== Controlling how a request is processed

You can use the `return_timeout` query parameter to control how an asynchronous API call is processed. There are two possible outcomes when using this parameter.

Timer expires before the request completes::
For valid requests, ONTAP returns a 202 HTTP status code along with the job object. You must retrieve the state of the job to determine if the request completed successfully.

Request is completed before the timer expires::
If the request is valid and completes successfully before the time expires, ONTAP returns a 200 HTTP status code along with the job object. Because the request is completed synchronously, as indicated by the 200, you do not need to retrieve the job state.
+
[NOTE]
The default value for the `return_timeout` parameter is zero seconds. Therefore, if you don't include the parameter, the 202 HTTP status code is always returned for a valid request.

=== Querying the Job object associated with an API request

The Job object returned in the HTTP response contains several properties. You can query the state property in a subsequent API call to determine if the request completed successfully. A Job object is always in one of the following states:

Non-terminal states::
+
* Queued
* Running
* Paused

Terminal states::
+
* Success
* Failure

=== General procedure for issuing an asynchronous request

You can use the following high-level procedure to complete an asynchronous API call. This example assumes the `return_timeout` parameter is not used, or that the time expires before the background job completes.

. Issue an API call that is designed to be performed asynchronously.
. Receive an HTTP response 202 indicating acceptance of a valid request.
. Extract the identifier for the Job object from the response body.
. Within a timed loop, perform the following in each cycle:
.. Get the current state of the Job.
.. If the Job is in a non-terminal state, perform loop again.
. Stop when the Job reaches a terminal state (success, failure).
