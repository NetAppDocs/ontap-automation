ONTAP collects performance metrics about selected SVM storage objects and protocols, and reports this information through the REST API. You can use this data to monitor the performance of an ONTAP system.

For a given storage object or protocol, the performance data falls into three categories:

* IOPS
* Latency
* Throughput

Within each category, one or more of the following types of data is available:

* Read (R)
* Write (W)
* Other (O)
* Total (T)

The following table summarizes the performance data available through the ONTAP REST API,  including the release when it was added. Refer to the REST API online documentation page at your ONTAP system for more information.
