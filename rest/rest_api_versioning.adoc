The REST API included with ONTAP 9 is assigned a version number which is independent of the ONTAP release number. You should be aware of the API version included with your release of ONTAP and how this might affect your use of the API.

[NOTE]
All versions of ONTAP 9 use the same version of the REST API.

ONTAP 9.6 through ONTAP 9.10.1::
Version 1
